# Digilib-Audit
The digilib might have (a) orphaned files not present in KLAP, (b) missing files listed in KLAP, and (b) albums that need digitizing from our CD library. The script(s) in this repo will perform a comprehensive audit of KLAP and the digilib and create a report for the Music Director to evaluate, permitting them to understand which CDs need digitizing, which digilib files need entry into KLAP or possible deletion, and which digital albums need to be redownloaded.
